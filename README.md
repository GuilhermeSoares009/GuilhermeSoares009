# Guilherme Soares

### Software Engineer | Cloud Computing 

I engineer high-performance distributed systems and automate cloud infrastructure. My work involves architecting resilient services using **Java, Go, and AWS**, while leveraging **AI-native** workflows and **Data Engineering** pipelines. 

With expertise spanning **Node.js, Python, and Rust**, and a solid foundation in **PHP and Laravel**, I bridge the gap between reliable web architecture and complex, modern infrastructure challenges.
